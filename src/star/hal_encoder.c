/*
 * star/hal_encoder.c -- Raptor HAL video encoder, SigmaStar MI backend
 *
 * Counterpart to src/hal_encoder.c (Ingenic IMP Encoder).
 *
 * The mapping is direct: raptor encoder channel N is MI VENC channel N,
 * fed by a VPE output port through MI_SYS_BindChnPort2. What differs
 * from IMP is worth stating up front, because it shapes the file:
 *
 *  - MI has no encoder *groups*. IMP's model is group -> registered
 *    channel -> bind; MI's is a plain module-to-module bind. So
 *    enc_create_group and its inverse are accepted and recorded but
 *    issue no MI call, and for a video stream the real connection is
 *    made by hal_bind in hal_common.c. Returning RSS_ERR_NOTSUP instead
 *    would fail rvd's pipeline setup for a concept the hardware simply
 *    does not have.
 *
 *    enc_register_channel is where that stops being free. rvd skips the
 *    bind chain entirely for JPEG streams, because on IMP registering a
 *    second channel into the paired video stream's group is what feeds
 *    it -- so a no-op register here would leave the JPEG channel
 *    connected to nothing at all. It brings up a VPE output port of its
 *    own for the JPEG channel instead. See the comment on
 *    hal_enc_register_channel for the vendor rules that make a dedicated
 *    port the right shape rather than a shared one.
 *
 *  - MI packs several NAL units into one stream *pack*. IMP hands back
 *    one NAL per pack, which is what rss_frame_t's nals[] was shaped
 *    for. See star_enc_fill_nals for how that is reconciled, and why
 *    the pack -- not its packetInfo entries -- is what becomes an
 *    rss_nal_unit_t.
 *
 *  - Rate control is set at channel creation and changed by
 *    read-modify-write on the channel attributes. MI has no per-knob
 *    setter for bitrate/gop/fps, so enc_set_bitrate and friends all
 *    funnel through star_enc_reconfigure_rate.
 *
 * Ops that are absent from the vtable in hal_common.c rather than
 * stubbed here: everything under RC options, ROI, GDR, p-skip, SRD,
 * denoise, crop, super-frame, colour-to-grey, entropy mode, buffer
 * pools and stream-SHM injection. MI either has no equivalent or
 * exposes it through MI_VENC_SetParam* structures that nothing in rvd
 * asks for on this SoC; RSS_HAL_CALL turns each into RSS_ERR_NOTSUP.
 *
 * Two of those absences are load-bearing and must stay absent:
 * enc_get_rmem_info and enc_inject_stream_shm. They are what enable
 * rvd's *refmode*, where the ring carries an (offset, length) reference
 * into the encoder's output memory instead of a copy, and the consumer
 * reads it after the HAL has already released the frame. That is safe
 * on Ingenic, whose encoder writes each frame into a distinct rmem
 * slot. It is not safe here: three consecutive frames of 61634, 2582
 * and 4073 bytes were measured landing at the same address
 * (0xb607c000 / phys 0x302c3000), so MI reuses the stream buffer as
 * soon as MI_VENC_ReleaseStream hands it back. A reference published
 * across that boundary reads whatever the next frame overwrote it with.
 *
 * Leaving both ops unimplemented is what keeps refmode off: rvd's
 * encoder thread falls back to embedded (copying) publication when
 * ref_base is zero, which is exactly what a NOTSUP enc_get_rmem_info
 * produces. Anyone implementing either one later has to solve the
 * buffer lifetime first -- by holding the frame until the consumer is
 * done, or by copying into a region MI does not recycle.

 * MI emits one pack per frame containing several NAL units, described
 * by pack->packetInfo[0..packNum-1] as {type, offset, length}.
 *
 * The addresses here come only from documented fields -- the vendor

 * bytes -- and packetInfo is used exclusively to *type* the pack:
 * scanned for a slice NAL to report as the pack's type and to decide
 * is_key. Nothing downstream needs finer granularity, because rvd
 * publishes a frame's NALs as one concatenated byte run into the ring
 * and rsd's Annex-B transport re-splits on start codes anyway.
 *
 * Measured on an SSC30KQ, since the vendor reference leaves it
 * unstated:
 *
 *   - packetInfo offsets are relative to the start of the pack's valid
 *     data and tile it exactly -- an IDR pack of 61634 bytes came back
 *     as SPS at 0 (24 bytes), PPS at 24 (8), IDR at 32 (61602), each
 *     landing on an Annex-B start code. So per-NAL addressing is
 *     available to a later phase that wants it; divinus's reading is
 *     the correct one. (pack->offset was 0 on every pack, so "relative
 *     to pu8Addr" and "relative to pu8Addr + u32Offset" coincide and
 *     the run cannot separate them. They agree here, which is what
 *     matters.)
 *
 *   - pack->naluType is the pack's *primary* NAL type, not its first:
 *     that SPS+PPS+IDR pack reported ISLICE, not SPS. The refinement
 *     loop below therefore agrees with pack->naluType rather than

 * On IMP this is IMP_Encoder_RegisterChn, and for a JPEG stream it is
 * the whole of how frames reach the encoder: rvd skips the bind chain
 * for JPEG (`if (!s->is_jpeg)`, rvd_pipeline.c:1248) because registering
 * a second channel into the paired video stream's *group* is enough --
 * the group is already bound to the framesource, so both registered
 * channels are fed.
 *
 * MI has no groups, so a validity check here is not enough: it would
 * leave the JPEG channel connected to nothing at all. MI_VENC_CreateChn
 * runs, MI_VENC_StartRecvPic runs, no VPE port is ever bound, and
 * enc_poll times out forever -- silently, because rvd_frame_loop.c reads
 * a JPEG poll timeout as the expected "sensor idle" case. That failure
 * looks like /snap returning "No snapshot available yet" with a healthy
 * ring and a working H.264 stream, and `logread | grep 'bind: VPE port'`
 * showing two binds on a two-video-plus-two-JPEG pipeline instead of
 * four. That grep is the standing check that this function did its job.
 *
 * So this has to satisfy the group/register contract in MI's own terms.
 * Preferred shape is a VPE output port of the JPEG channel's own, because
 * that is the vendor's model twice over: MI_SYS_BindChnPort2's Note says
 * "the source and destination ports must not have been previously bound",
 * and MI_SYS's architecture section says VPE "has one InputPort and
 * multiple OutputPorts ... Vpe shares the same data source, but must have
 * different output formats of different specifications" -- one output
 * port per consumer, not an optimisation of one.
 *
 * A dedicated port also buys the rate pacing. MI_SYS_BindChnPort2 takes
 * separate source and destination frame rates, so the port is bound at
 * the JPEG stream's fps (1 by default) against a source running at the
 * sensor's, and MI drops the rest in hardware. That matters because
 * INFINITY6E's caps block does not set .jpeg_pulse, so rvd's duty-cycling
 * -- the thing that stops an Ingenic JPEG channel encoding at full rate
 * and discarding almost all of it -- is off here.
 *
 * Preferred, but not required: STAR_VPE_PORT_NUM ports are not guaranteed
 * to exist, and two video streams with JPEG on both want every one of
 * them, so the code falls back to sharing the paired stream's port rather
 * than giving up. See the fallback below for what that trades away.
 *
 * Failures warn and return RSS_OK rather than propagating. rvd treats a
 * register failure as fatal to the stream, and a board that cannot feed
 * its JPEG channel should lose its snapshots, not its video. Every such
 * exit says so in the log: a JPEG path that quietly does nothing is
 * indistinguishable from one that works until someone asks it for a
 * picture, and telling those apart from a log is the whole point.
