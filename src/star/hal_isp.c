/*
 * star/hal_isp.c -- ISP tuning and 3A for the SigmaStar MI HAL
 *
 * ================================================================
 * THE POINT OF THIS FILE
 *
 * Phases 2c-2e produced a correct video pipeline with a visibly wrong
 * image: colours off, because enabling VPE auto-starts CUS3A and CUS3A
 * loads /etc/firmware/iqfile0.bin -- a generic tuning file that knows
 * nothing about the attached sensor. OpenIPC already ships a tuned
 * binary per sensor (/etc/sensors/<name>.bin), so the single most
 * valuable thing this file does is load the right one. Everything else
 * here is secondary, and some of it is actively better left undone --
 * see THE TUNING BINARY OUTRANKS THE CONFIG below.
 * ================================================================
 *
 * ================================================================
 * TWO SHAPES OF MI_ISP CALL, AND WHY THERE IS A TABLE
 *
 * libmi_isp.so exports ~360 functions. A handful are typed lifecycle
 * calls with real prototypes in i6_isp.h. The other ~340 are
 * MI_ISP_{IQ,AE,AWB,AF}_{Get,Set}<Module>, all of them
 * (int channel, void *payload), each with its own payload struct.
 *
 * Writing 340 structs to poke one field each would be absurd, and it is
 * not necessary: the payloads follow a fixed convention, discovered by
 * OpenIPC waybeam_venc (src/star6e_iq.c) and confirmed here against the
 * board's own library. An auto/manual module looks like
 *
 *     { uint32 bEnable; uint32 enOpType; <auto>[16]; <manual>; }
 *
 * where <auto> is 16 copies of a per-ISO parameter block, so the manual
 * block always begins at 8 + 16 * sizeof(per_iso_param). A manual-only
 * module drops enOpType and the auto array (manual at offset 4), and a
 * toggle-only module is just bEnable.
 *
 * So one field is reachable with (payload size, manual offset, width) and
 * no struct at all. Both numbers are verifiable without vendor headers:
 * each wrapper hardcodes its payload size, so
 *
 *     arm-openipc-linux-gnueabihf-objdump -d \
 *         --disassemble=MI_ISP_IQ_GetBrightness libmi_isp.so
 *
 * prints `mov.w r3, #76` into the size slot. Every entry in the table
 * below was checked that way, and the check is sharper than it sounds:
 * brightness is a u32 at manual offset 72 in a 76-byte payload, so the
 * manual value is provably the last four bytes and the convention is
 * confirmed rather than assumed. Saturation (392 in 416), sharpness
 * (1192 in 1268), NRLuma (104 in 112) and NR3D (1288 in 1776) all agree.
 *
 * Every access is read-modify-write. That is what makes poking one field
 * of a struct we have not fully described safe: whatever else the
 * payload holds -- and NR3D holds 1776 bytes of it -- survives untouched.
 * ================================================================
 *
 * ================================================================
 * THE TUNING BINARY OUTRANKS THE CONFIG
 *
 * rvd applies its whole [image] block unconditionally at startup, using
 * built-in defaults for every key the config omits (rvd_pipeline.c,
 * section 3c). A HAL that dutifully wrote all of them would flip nine
 * ISP modules from auto to manual on every boot -- overwriting, with
 * hardcoded midpoints, the tuned curves it had just loaded from the
 * sensor binary. The image would be worse than before this file existed.
 *
 * So a scalar knob at its neutral value (128) does not mean "write 128".
 * It means "nobody asked for anything", and this file answers it by
 * putting the module back into *auto*, which is where the tuning binary
 * wants it. Only a value that differs from neutral selects manual mode.
 * The mapping is reversible: setting a knob and then returning it to 128
 * restores auto rather than pinning the midpoint.
 *
 * A consequence worth stating plainly: a user who genuinely wants manual
 * brightness at exactly the midpoint cannot express it, and gets auto.
 * That trade is deliberate -- the alternative penalises every default
 * configuration to serve a request nobody has made.
 * ================================================================
 *
 * ================================================================
 * OP COVERAGE -- what is missing, and why
 *
 * Absent ops return RSS_ERR_NOTSUP through RSS_HAL_CALL's NULL guard,
 * and rvd treats all of these as advisory. Left unimplemented on
 * purpose:
 *
 *   isp_set_dpc_strength  MI's DynamicDP manual field is one bit. A
 *                         0..255 strength knob does not map onto it, and
 *                         pretending otherwise reads as support for a
 *                         control that has two positions.
 *   isp_set_defog_strength / _adv
 *                         Same: MI's Defog is a toggle. The plain
 *                         isp_set_defog *is* implemented.
 *   isp_set_drc_strength, isp_set_highlight_depress,
 *   isp_set_backlight_comp
 *                         These live in WDR/HDR modules whose manual
 *                         blocks are multi-field curve descriptors, not
 *                         single strengths. Mapping one scalar onto a
 *                         curve is a tuning decision, not a HAL one.
 *   isp_set_hue           MI's hue control is a 64-entry HSV LUT
 *                         (manual@3096); a scalar rotation would mean
 *                         synthesising the whole table.
 *   isp_set_wb / isp_get_wb
 *                         AWB_SetAttr's 1464-byte payload is not
 *                         described by the offset convention above (it
 *                         is not an auto/manual pair), so it needs its
 *                         own derivation. Deferred rather than guessed.
 *   isp_set_bypass        No MI equivalent; the ISP cannot be bypassed
 *                         while VPE is the only path to the encoder.

 * ================================================================
 * WHY THE TUNING LOAD IS NOT DONE HERE
 *
 * The first board run of this file had every single MI_ISP call fail
 * with 6 and the parameter store never come ready. The cause is
 * ordering, and it is structural rather than a matter of waiting longer.
 *
 * MI has no independent ISP device. Disassembling any
 * MI_ISP_{IQ,AE}_Get<Module> shows it delegate to
 * _MI_ISP_GetIspApiData, which dispatches through a per-channel handler
 * table and, where no handler is registered, falls back to
 * MI_VPE_GetIspApiData -- the ISP is answered *by the VPE channel*. And
 * a VPE channel with no enabled output port has nowhere to send frames,
 * so it does not run, so its ISP front end never initialises and every
 * query is refused.
 *
 * At hal_init time that is exactly the state: star_vpe_bringup has
 * created, started and bound the channel, but the output ports belong to
 * the framesource ops and no caller has enabled one yet. Waiting longer
 * cannot help -- nothing was going to happen.
 *
 * Both references get this right by construction rather than by
 * explanation: divinus loads its IQ file at the very end of sdk_init,
 * after the encoding thread is already running (media.c:827), and
 * waybeam loads after its output and video stages are up. So the load
 * moves to star_isp_tune_when_ready, which the framesource and encoder
 * start paths call once frames can actually flow.
 *
 * What stays here is only what is safe before the pipeline runs: binding
 * the library and working out which file to load. Neither touches MI.

 *
 * so a 16-point curve of target luma against scene light level:
 *
 *   struct { uint32_t count; uint32_t target[16]; int32_t light[16]; }
 *
 * 1 + 16 + 16 words is 132 bytes exactly, which is the size the vendor's
 * own wrapper moves into its API descriptor -- not a reconstruction. Three
 * further things agree with the reading: the light axis is strictly
 * increasing and mostly spaced by exactly 16384, so it is a fixed-point
 * log scale; the target array is *not* monotonic, rising to 480 and
 * falling back, which is what an AE curve does to protect highlights in a
 * bright scene; and 350..480 in eighths is 43.75..60, bracketing the
 * ae_luma this board reports in daylight.
 *
 * The unit of either axis is still not identified, and this does not need
 * it: scaling the whole curve by a ratio is the same operation whatever
 * the units are. That is the reason the knob is a proportion rather than
 * an absolute target.
 *
 * The layout is checked rather than trusted, on every read -- see
 * star_ae_target_valid. A wrong layout then declines instead of writing
 * nonsense into the control loop that decides every exposure.

 * Two calls, and the second one is optional. MI_ISP_CUS3A_GetAeStatus
 * gives shutter and both gains, which is a complete ambient-light signal
 * on its own: a scene going dark drives the shutter and then the gain up,
 * and ric's night->day rule compares gain against its own night baseline

 * luma, which ric's day->night rule prefers because IR illumination does
 * not inflate it the way it inflates gain.

 * equivalent) and wb_rgain/wb_bgain (MI_ISP_AWB_GetAwbHwAvgStats exists,

 * Leaving them zero is what tells ric the photo trigger has nothing to
 * work with -- see the zero convention below.
 *
 * ================================================================
 * ZERO MEANS "NOT AVAILABLE", AND THAT IS A CONTRACT, NOT A HABIT
 *
 * The Ingenic backend already works this way: when GetAeStatistics
 * fails it warns once and leaves ae_luma at 0 so that "day/night falls
 * back to gain-only behavior" (src/hal_isp.c). A backend that cannot
 * answer for a field leaves it zero, and the consumer must read zero as
 * silence rather than as a reading.
 *
 * It matters most for luma, where the two readings sit at opposite ends:
 * a live sensor never reports a mean luma of exactly 0, and ric's
 * day->night test is `ae_luma < night_luma`. So a zero read as data is
 * the darkest possible scene, so a backend with no luma source that
 * reported zero here would pin the camera in night mode forever.

/*
 * Reload the tuning binary when the ISP is found back on its defaults.
 *
 * Loading the api bin plainly works: two different bins produce two
 * different AE limit sets (24576/100000 and 131072/50000), read back from
 * the AE immediately after the load. But `1024..8192` and `..14000` are
 * the limits the ISP reports with *no tuning file at all* -- a deliberately
 * failed load reports exactly those numbers -- and that is where this
 * board's AE otherwise sits, permanently.
 *
 * So the bin lands and is then wiped, and a whole family of symptoms
 * follows from that one cause: the AE ignoring limits widened underneath
 * it, an OEM _night bin that forces monochrome under divinus doing nothing
 * here, deleting the bin changing nothing, and white balance being wrong
 * under artificial light.
 *
 * What wipes it is deliberately not chased any further. The shape is
 * known -- this port already documents that CUS3A re-auto-starts when a
 * VPE channel's last output port goes down, and rvd tunes on the *first*
 * framesource enable, before the sub-stream, the OSD attach and the
 * encoder start, whereas divinus loads at the end of sdk_init once its
 * encoder thread is running (media.c:827) and is fine on the same board
 * and bin. But naming the exact step means bisecting vendor library
 * behaviour that no documentation describes, and the answer would only
 * hold for this SDK build: any *other* step MI resets the ISP from, on
 * another board or another release, would put the tuning back where it
 * started. Detecting the state and repairing it covers all of them.
 *
 * The limits are a reliable witness because the tuning's own values were
 * snapshotted before anything could overwrite them, and because the only
 * other thing that writes them is this file -- so "neither what the
 * tuning published nor what the config asked for" means the ISP went back
 * to its defaults underneath us.
 *
 * A reload restores the tuning's own state, config knobs and all, which
 * is exactly what star_isp_flush_pending exists to put back; without that
 * call a repair would silently drop a configured ceiling. Bounded,
 * because a reload that does not stick must not turn into a loop -- and
 * if the bound is reached, the log says so, which is a better failure
 * than silence.
