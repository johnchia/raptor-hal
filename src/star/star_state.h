/*
 * star/star_state.h -- shared backend state for the SigmaStar MI HAL
 *
 * Exists because the MI backend spans more than one translation unit:
 * hal_common.c owns the pipeline lifecycle (MI_SYS / MI_SNR / MI_VIF /
 * the VPE channel) and hal_framesource.c owns the VPE output ports, and
 * both need the same loaded-library handles and sensor descriptors.
 *
 * It cannot live in hal_internal.h: that header is included *by* the
 * i6_*.h ABI headers (for HAL_LOG_ERR and RSS_ERR_*), so it must not
 * include them back. rss_hal_ctx_t->platform points at the
 * star_state_t below for exactly this reason -- see the MI BACKEND
 * STATE comment in hal_common.c.
