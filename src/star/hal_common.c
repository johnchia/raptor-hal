/*
 * star/hal_common.c -- Raptor HAL common layer, SigmaStar MI backend
 *
 * Counterpart to src/hal_common.c (Ingenic IMP). Provides the factory
 * functions, the ops vtable, and the logging hook for SigmaStar Infinity6E
 * parts.
 *
 * Why a separate translation unit rather than #ifdefs in src/hal_common.c:
 * the existing HAL_OLD_SDK/HAL_NEW_SDK/HAL_IMPVI_SDK conditionals all
 * distinguish *generations of the same vendor SDK*, where the call
 * sequences are near-identical and only struct layouts and enum names
 * differ. MI is a different SDK with a different pipeline model
 * (VIF -> VPE -> VENC channel/port binding rather than
 * FrameSource -> Encoder groups), so sharing a file would mean two
 * disjoint implementations behind mutually exclusive guards rather than
 * one implementation with variations.
 *
 * Current state: skeleton. The vtable deliberately publishes only the ops
 * that are actually implemented. RSS_HAL_CALL() NULL-guards every entry
 * and returns RSS_ERR_NOTSUP for unset ones (see raptor_hal.h), so
 * unimplemented subsystems need no stub functions and no stub files --
 * omitting them from the vtable is the supported way to express
 * "not available on this platform".

 *
 * Used for both the VIF port and the VPE channel input, since the same
 * bayer frames cross both and both references derive it identically
 * (divinus i6_hal.c:293 and :306, waybeam star6e_pipeline.c:475 and
 * :523).
 *
 * Both references ignore the plane's own pixFmt for bayer sensors and
 * recompute it as RGB_BAYER + precision * I6_BAYER_END + bayer (divinus
 * i6_hal.c:293, waybeam star6e_pipeline.c:475 -- the same expression in
 * both; waybeam uses it unconditionally, divinus falls back to the reported
 * field only when the plane is not bayer at all). We do the same, because
 * hardware settled which one is right.
 *
 * The GC4653 driver reports pixFmt 41 for a plane it simultaneously describes
 * as bayer GR(1) at 10bpp, where the formula gives 20 + 1*12 + 1 = 33. The
 * tempting reading -- that the vendor's bayer-id stride is 20 rather than the
 * 12 our i6_common_bayer implies, since 41 == 20 + 1*20 + 1 -- is wrong. With
 * 41 programmed, MI's own proc table decoded it back as "I0_10BPP", and I0 is
 * index 9 in this enum: exactly what 41 means under the references' formula
 * (41 - 20 = 21 -> precision 1, bayer 9). So the vendor's stride is 12, our
 * enum's ordering is confirmed correct by MI's own decode, and 41 selects an
 * IR pattern that contradicts the driver's own bayer field.
 *
 * The driver is simply unreliable in this field, which is presumably why
 * neither reference trusts it. Derive whenever the plane describes a real
 * bayer pattern, and fall back to the reported value only when it does not --
 * there the formula is meaningless (a YUV sensor, say) and the reported field
 * is all there is. (divinus tests `bayer > I6_BAYER_END`, which feeds the
 * sentinel itself through the formula; the difference is unreachable for real
 * values, but >= is what the sentence above actually means.)
