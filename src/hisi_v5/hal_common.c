/*
 * hisi_v5/hal_common.c -- Raptor HAL common layer, HiSilicon HiMPP V5.0
 *
 * Counterpart to src/hisi_v4/hal_common.c, and a separate translation unit
 * from it for the reason PLAN-hi3516cv610.md sets out at length: V5 renamed
 * every entry point, moved every layout, and split one libmpi.so into four
 * libraries. Sharing a file with gen4 would mean hiding an argument list
 * behind a macro at nearly every call site.
 *
 * Everything here guards on HAL_HISI_GEN5, never on PLATFORM_HI3516CV610.
 * The generation is the unit of compatibility and the *platform name is the
 * ABI's, not the die's*: OpenIPC builds one MPP for the whole hi3516cv6xx
 * family, and this file was brought up on a CV608 whose libraries report
 * "HI3516CV610_MPP_V1.0.2.0 B051 Release". The die reaches raptor
 * separately, as soc_model, and reaches this file as the chip name read
 * from /proc/umap/sys.
 *
 * Current state: Phase 1 skeleton. The vtable publishes only the ops that
 * are implemented; RSS_HAL_CALL() NULL-guards every entry and returns
 * RSS_ERR_NOTSUP for the rest, so unimplemented subsystems need no stubs.
 * A Phase 1 daemon comes up, logs the MPP version and the part, reaches
 * ss_mpi_sys_init, finds no framesource and exits cleanly. The video
 * pipeline lands in Phase 2.

 * FORWARDERS -- breaking the ISP / algorithm-library cycle
 *
 * This block is why raptor-hal's HiSilicon builds pass
 * -Wl,--export-dynamic unconditionally, and why it lives in *this* file
 * rather than in a quirks.c of its own.
 *
 * raptor-hal ships as libraptor_hal_video.a. A static-archive member is
 * extracted only if something already linked references a symbol in it, and
 * nothing in raptor references isp_alg_register_drc. A standalone quirks.c
 * would therefore compile, archive, and never link -- and --export-dynamic
 * cannot export what was never linked. -Wl,--gc-sections and -flto compound
 * it. hal_common.c is the translation unit that defines rss_hal_create, so
 * it is always extracted; putting the definitions here is what makes them
 * exist at all. __attribute__((used)) then keeps LTO and --gc-sections from
 * discarding them, since nothing in the program refers to them either.
 *
 * THE CYCLE, AND WHY musl MAKES IT THE EXECUTABLE'S PROBLEM.
 *
 * libot_mpi_isp.so and the eight algorithm libraries reference each other:
 *
 *   libot_mpi_isp.so  -> isp_alg_register_ldci        (in libldci.so)
 *                        isp_alg_register_drc         (in libdrc.so)
 *                        isp_alg_register_dehaze      (in libdehaze.so)
 *                        isp_alg_register_bayer_nr    (in libbnr.so)
 *                        isp_alg_register_acs         (in libacs.so)
 *                        isp_ir_auto_run_once         (in libir_auto.so)
 *                        isp_be_stats_estimate        (in libextend_stats.so)
 *                        calc_flicker_type            (in libcalcflicker.so)
 *   libldci.so        -> 18 symbols in libot_mpi_isp.so
 *   libdrc.so         -> 18      "
 *   libdehaze.so      -> 18      "
 *   libbnr.so         -> 32      "
 *   libacs.so         -> 18      "
 *   libextend_stats.so-> 4       "
 *   libcalcflicker.so -> 3       "
 *   libir_auto.so     -> 1       "
 *
 * (Measured with readelf on the board's own 1.0.2.0 B051 libraries. Those
 * eight are *exactly* libot_mpi_isp.so's undefined set once libc,
 * libsecurec and libss_mpi are accounted for -- there is no ninth waiting
 * to be discovered.)
 *
 * musl implements no lazy binding at all: RTLD_LAZY is accepted and
 * ignored, and every dlopen relocates fully. So neither side of the cycle
 * can be opened first, and something outside it has to satisfy one
 * direction. The vendor never meets this, because Makefile.param links
 * libot_mpi_isp.a and libdrc.a statically; a shipping product that dlopens
 * would meet it the same way raptor does.
 *
 * So the executable defines the eight, and the cycle unrolls:
 *
 *   1. dlopen(libot_mpi_isp.so) -- its eight imports bind to these
 *      forwarders, already in the global scope. It loads.
 *   2. dlopen(libldci.so) and the rest -- their imports resolve against
 *      libot_mpi_isp.so, now loaded and RTLD_GLOBAL. They load.
 *   3. hisi_isp_open (Phase 2) dlsyms the real eight out of step 2 and
 *      stores them in the state.
 *   4. ss_mpi_isp_init calls isp_alg_register_drc, reaches this forwarder,
 *      and is passed through to the real one.
 *
 * Step 4 is why the forwarders must stay valid for the process lifetime and
 * cannot become one-shot: libot_mpi_isp.so's GOT entry was bound once, at
 * its own dlopen, and points here for good.
 *
 * Each forwards through g_hisi rather than through a file-static pointer,
 * so the forwarders and the ISP loader cannot disagree about which library
 * is current. Before Phase 2 fills those pointers -- and after hal_deinit
 * clears them -- every one returns V5_FAILURE, and a vendor caller that
 * gets TD_FAILURE from a registrar declines to register, which is the
 * correct outcome when there is no algorithm library to register with.
 *
 * gen4's other three trampoline groups are absent here, and deliberately:
 * the uClibc ABI group (__ctype_b and friends) and the mmap shim both
 * existed because gen4's vendor libraries are uClibc builds. The V5 set is
 * musl-built and DT_NEEDEDs libc.so; the unresolved-symbol closure over all
 * 60 vendor libraries on the board leaves nothing of either shape. The
 * Goke group has no V5 counterpart at all. See v5_common.h.

 * ISP its pixels on chip. That is one whole sensor-sized VB block per
 * frame in flight -- measured at 3,732,480 bytes of a 32 MB MMZ on the
 * CV608 -- bought for nothing but the loss of raw dump and raw send,
 * neither of which this backend offers. The tuning guide's own table
 * ("性能╱带宽╱延时╱内存调优指南", 各模块内存相关可优化配置 / VI) puts the
 * saving at 1-2 VB for the online couplings against full offline.
 *
 * VPSS stays OFFLINE for gen4's reason: an online VPSS is fed in
 * hardware, which makes the software bind wrong and the channel enable a
 * no-op. Going online there as well would take a second block, and is
 * the next thing to measure -- but it also restricts the group to one
 * pipe and forbids VI channel post-processing, so it is a Phase 7
 * decision with a bench behind it rather than a default.
 *
 * Asking explicitly matters either way: the board does not necessarily
 * boot in any particular coupling.
 *
 * Read-modify-write rather than build-and-set, following the vendor: the
 * array has an entry per pipe and writing a fresh one would reset the mode
 * of a pipe this backend does not drive. **V5's array is four wide, not
 * gen4's two**: two physical pipes plus two virtual ones.
 *
 * Failure is a warning, not an error. The driver has a default, and
 * refusing to start a pipeline because the mode could not be confirmed
 * would trade a working camera for a tidier log.

/*
 * hisi_vb_fill_cfg -- the common pool configuration.
 *
 * ONE POOL PER CONSUMER, cut to that consumer's own frame. This is the
 * vendor's shape rather than an invention: sample_venc.c's get_vb_attr
 * walks the pipeline and calls update_vb_attr once per stage with that
 * stage's geometry, pixel format and compress mode, then sets
 * max_pool_cnt to however many stages there were. VB hands a request the
 * smallest pool whose blocks are big enough, so exact sizes are the
 * mechanism that stops one stage's frame from occupying another's block.
 *
 * The size-class scheme this replaces -- a full-sensor pool and a
 * quarter-scale one -- was measured on the CV608 and did not work. The
 * quarter pool's blocks came out at 576x324 = 279,936 bytes and the
 * smallest real stream was 640x360 = 345,600, so every sub-stream frame
 * took a 4.27 MiB full-size block and the whole second pool sat unused
 * from boot to teardown. Four blocks then had to serve four simultaneous
 * consumers, VI never saw a spare, and 42% of frames were dropped on
 * vb_fail. A size class only works if something is actually that size.
 *
 * WHAT hal_init KNOWS is the sensor, so what it configures is the VI
 * side:
 *
 *   pool 0   the VI channel's NV21 output at the sensor's size, which is
 *            also what the VPSS group reads over the bind.
 *
 * The VPSS channels are deliberately not here. Their geometry is rvd's
 * and arrives later, and each gets a pool cut to its own stream in
 * hisi_fs_pool_acquire. A channel whose pool could not be created falls
 * back to these common pools, which is the other reason pool 0 is sized
 * for the largest frame in the pipeline rather than the VI channel alone.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO RAW POOL. The VI pipe puts a raw Bayer frame in a VB
 * block only while it is offline, and hisi_vi_vpss_mode asks for VI
 * online. If that request is ever refused, the pipe falls back to
 * allocating raw from pool 0 -- and a sensor-sized NV21 block is larger
 * than a raw one at every bit depth this backend drives (4,478,976
 * against 3,732,480 at 2304x1296 RAW10), so the fallback costs a block
 * rather than failing to start. The coupling actually in force is logged
 * by hisi_vi_vpss_mode for exactly this reason.
 *
 * THE BLOCK COUNT is three, where the vendor's VI_VB_YUV_CNT is four.
 * The tuning guide's rule (DDR内存调优 / 主要模块工作占用MMZ情况 / VI) is
 * that VI holds at most three frame VBs -- one being filled, one ready for
 * the next frame, one in rotation downstream -- and that a VPSS group
 * holds its input frame plus a backup, which CV610 cannot disable.
 *
 * Four does not fit. This part has 32 MB of MMZ and four sensor-sized
 * blocks are 17.9 MB of it; with the two stream pools on top,
 * ss_mpi_venc_create_chn then fails 0xa0088014 -- OT_ERR_NO_MEM -- because
 * VENC's reference and reconstruction frames do not come out of VB and
 * there is nothing left for them. Three is 13.4 MB and leaves the encoder
 * its room.
 *
 * If this turns out to be one too few it says so precisely, and the fix
 * is a number: /proc/umap/vb reports min_free per pool, and the tuning
 * guide's own advice is to read it -- a min_free that never leaves 0 while
 * VI's vb_fail_cnt climbs is a pool one block short.
 *
 * The audio archive compiles this file too and has no sensor mode, so the
 * whole thing is video-only and hal_init falls back to no pools.
